# OreoCPD
Central Power Distribution Controller for Crown Vic Equiptment Console

The OreoCPD Project is one of my first big projects

This program is built around the following hardware
- Raspberry Pi B+ as the computer
- 5V relays (120v max)
- Node MCU as the network for ssh
- lots and lots of wiring
- The modules in my specific car though with manipulation, it'll work with almost anything as a control panel

Once I figure the kinks out and get the nodemcu running as a proper AP, I will post images of everything.

Pull the code, change it, make it better! Thats why we're here right? ;)

plus im reaaaaaaly tired and don't even wanna make a readme.md lol
